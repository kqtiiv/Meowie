# Meowie

The Website
Meow! Welcome to my website! Here, you can talk to other cats - just log in and click the Meowie button in the navbar!

The developer
My name is Katie - also known as kqtiiv. I am a computer science student, who enjoys web development, game development, cryptography and theoretical computing. My goal is to study CS at University and work in the sector in the future. Evidently, I also like cats, and they would greatly appreciate any form of donation to aid in web hosting and game hosting.

I want more!
If you like this website, I'd be incredibly grateful if you checked out my other creations and social media (linked below).

Meow appreciates you :)
Thank you for taking the time to read this with the most unreadable (but cute) font and have a have a meow-velous day!
